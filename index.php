 <h3>Welcome to my page @ Seattle Central College</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Taher Ahmed and I moved to Seattle 2 years ago with my wife and my lovely daughter from the <b>13 months</b>
 sunshine country Ethiopia, Africa.</p>
        
    <p>I was born in Mekelle town, Tigray region, Ethiopia. I grew up in Mekelle. In Seattle, after six months working with out profession,
 I have decided to continue education. In order to work professionally, and become a role model for my daughter I decided to return back to education.
 I devoted my self to grueling practices daily throughout the year and developed an effective time-managemet, through which I balanced school, 
family and ful-time job while dedicating myself fully to both. As parents are a big role models for the good and for the bad deeds.<p>
		
<h3> My Hobbies</h3>

<p> My plan is to complete the Web development and Database Administration in double major in Seattle Central College. 
I hope to become all rounded Full stack software Developer or Front end and back end developer. 
It includes developing Websites, developing and administering databases, softare applications, mobile spplications
 and connecting with database. I hope to continue education, even  with some challenges and in my old age also.
 It certainly have become more than a hobby and more of a daily pracetice of passion and wellness.  </p>

She loved running on Tracks,Parks and playing soccer and playing mobile games. she had no fear! Her favorite thing about 
the city and our community is, there are many parks around our apartment!</p>

When Nizam miss her country and her grandma and grndfa and our family, she cries and I wrote poems about my family, my country and about her. 
It greatly touched my heart that my daughter needs to communicate always and she try to call using video calls to back home to express herself
 and her feelings and she try to represent in her art about her background.</p>
